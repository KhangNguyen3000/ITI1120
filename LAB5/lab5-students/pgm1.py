Recall that a sequence of numbers forms an arithmetic progression if the difference
between every pair of consecutive numbers is the same. For example: -5, -1, 3, 7, 11
forms an arithmetic progression since the difference between every pair of
consecutive numbers is 4. On the contrary 5, 10, 15, 24, 29 is not an arithmetic
progression since the difference between some consecutive pairs is 5 and some 4.
A sequence that has exactly one number is considered arithmetic, too
